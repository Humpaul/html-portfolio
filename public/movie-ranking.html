<h1>BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h1>
<h2>In no particular order, top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kimetsu no yaiba</h3>
<p>One of the best animes so far, love the art style and plot (the fighting scenes are really cool)</p>
<h3>John Wick 3</h3>
<p>Should rank in my top 10 action movies, a lot of fight scenes</p>
<h3>Sisu</h3>
<p>Also from the makers of John Wick, a refreshing point of view compared to its counterpart</p>
